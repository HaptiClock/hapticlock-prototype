* Roadmap
** Hardware
*** TODO Add RTC
*** TODO Test haptic motor range
Observe motor response for 2-5V input.
** Software
*** TODO Add force sensor
*** TODO Add RTC
*** TODO Add Hapticlock class to store all sensors
*** TODO Add second capacitive touch
*** TODO Rewrite =checkCapacitiveEvents()= to handle second capacitive touch
*** TODO Add haptic breakout boards
*** TODO Figure out class system for haptic and time sequence building and actuating
*** TODO Add downtime between next cap and force reading
*** TODO Calibration mode for capacitive touch
Is this even necessary?
** Haptic Time Protocol
A Haptic Time Protocol (HTP) is necessary to define how time will be transmitted via haptics. This protocol is intended to be independent of hardware.
*** Design Characteristics
1. Precision: what time precision does the protocol allow? Seconds, minutes, five minutes?
2. Number of fingers: how many motors are used?
3. Haptic characteristics: what haptic sequences are used? A simple pulse? A decaying pulse? Double-pulses? At what intensity and duration?
*** Precision
Seconds is unnecessary to know when waking up.

Minutes is necessary, but maybe to nearest five or ten.

Hours is necessary, down to nearest hour.

Given that Hapticlock is primarily intended for preventing ALAN exposure, can have different protocol for before.
*** Number of Fingers
| Number | Pros                                                 | Cons                                                                                                |
|--------+------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      1 | Simpler mechanical, electrical, and software design. | User cannot differentiate data types based on which finger (must use other haptic characteristics). |
|      2 | Doubles protocol message space.                      | User must achieve placement of both fingers. More complex design.                                   |
|      3 | Triples protocol message space.                      | User must achieve placement of three fingers. More complex design.                                  |
** Housing
*** TODO Determine external features
- capacitive fabric overlay zone(s)
- holes for haptic motors
- hole(s) for force sensor
- hole for charging cable
- hole for battery
*** TODO Determine internal features
- structural frame
- slots for haptic motors
- slots for force sensor
- battery holder
- PCB holder
*** TODO Design haptic motor tester
Design a small housing to test a single haptic motor. This is necessary to tune the haptic feedback.
** Configuration Interface
*** TODO Web server over WiFi
Configurable settings
- buzz intensities
- buzz lengths
- buzz wait times
*** TODO Launch web server with special tap and force sequence
*** TODO Determine how to store changes to configuration parameters
Config file parsed by the software?
